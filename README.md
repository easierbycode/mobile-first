mobile-first
============

The `mobile-first` custom element takes "Mobile First" to a whole new level.
If viewed on a desktop or tablet, it will embed its content within a mock image of a mobile device.
This will allow your users to experience your site as you originally intended.

The device can be rotated through mouse gestures, to view your site in landscape on the contained mock device.

## Why?

Why not?

## Usage

You can check out this code, and then include this element like this:

```html
<script src="mobile-first.js"></script>
<script type="module">
  // or using ES6 modules...
  import './mobile-first.js';
</script>
<mobile-first>
  <h5>Your Page!</h5>
</mobile-first>
```

Alternatively, you might contain a mobile-only site:

```html
<style type="text/css">
  /** Include this CSS for iframes so they fit the mock device. */
  mobile-first > iframe {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    border: 0;
  }
</style>
<mobile-first>
  <iframe src="mobile-site.html"></iframe>
</mobile-first>
```

There are a few attributes that can be modified.

* `device` controls the mock device used: currently, this supports "nexus5" and "iphone5". By default, `mobile-first` chooses a random device from its available devices.

* `width` may be set to explicitly control the width at which the `mobile-first` element shows a mock device.
  Below this width, this element will act as a boring `div` that just contains its contentâ€”ideal for your users who are already on a mobile device!

### Install

Install `mobile-first-element` on NPM (or `mobile-first` with Bower), and include the source.

## Support

Tested on Chrome 58+ and Safari 10.1 (without animations), may work on other browsers that support Custom Elements and Shadow DOM.
